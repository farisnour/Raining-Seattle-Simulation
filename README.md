# Raining In Seattle Problem

You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if you should bring an umbrella. You call 3 random friends of yours who live there and ask each independently if it’s raining. Each of your friends has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. All 3 friends tell you that “Yes” it is raining. What is the probability that it’s actually raining in Seattle?

The above markdown file simulates the process of running the experiment many times to estimate the probability. A preview can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/farisnour/Raining-Seattle-Simulation/blob/master/RainingInSeattle.html)
